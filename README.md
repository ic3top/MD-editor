* Type Markdown on the left 
* ✨ Magic ✨
* See parsed HTML in the right


Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email. As John Gruber writes on the Markdown site

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is actually written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.
